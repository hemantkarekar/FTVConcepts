                            Michel Adam Lisowski was born on April 16, 1950, in Warsaw and is of Jewish descent.
                            He moved to Vienna in 1958, along with his family. Later, he was granted a scholarship
                            for Mathematics at Princeton University. <br>
                            He started a textile business in Thailand called "Eden Group". In 1997, he started
                            FashionTV, an international fashion and lifestyle broadcasting television channel in
                            France. Currently, he is the Chairman of Fashion TV (FTV) and also runs the franchise
                            "love-f-cafe" in various European cities, including Monaco and Milan. <br>
                            In 2013, he returned to Vienna with the idea of opening a café at Hotel Bristol next to
                            the opera house. The café is still a renowned destination for many fashion shows,
                            after-parties, and other fashion events. The cafe became very popular amongst the
                            fashion community. <br>

                            In 1958 his journey began when he travelled from Poland to Vienna and decided to
                            venture into a subject that was the closest to his heart which is Fashion. <br>
                            At first, he started his own textile business in Thailand under a company called the Eden
                            Group. Later he moved to France where Michel Adam Lisowski started a channel that is
                            dedicated to fashion, it broadcasted 24*7. This led to the birth of FashionTV, in 1997.
                            Today, Fashion TV is loved globally and is the world’s largest fashion media. <br>
                            Later in 2013, he opened "love-f-cafe" Fashion, one of his most successful projects.
                            This cafe is dedicated to fashion enthusiasts. The café is known as a UTOPIA for
                            fashion. It hosts many fashion shows, after-parties, and other fashion events. This cafe
                            is in very high demand amongst the fashion community.
